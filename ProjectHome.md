We started working on creating a software tool to produce `only' Mandelbrot set in
color, and ended up creating a software tool capable of evaluating any Mathemati-
cal expression, to generate escape time fractals, in any color. While experimenting
with this tool, we came up with heather to unknown, unexplained phenomenon.
The phenomenon of shape preserving transform, and the phenomenon of embed-
ded inner fractal images, were so fascinating that we tried to explain them, so as
to generate a preliminary theoretical basis. The usage of transformation vector to
preserve shape and transform any nite truncated polynomial fractal is proven.
The dominance phenomenon we borrowed, and reused from Computer Science,
and shown that it is a very powerful mechanism to predict existence of embedded
inner fractals. While dominance principle shows promise, the principle is fairly
new at least in the fractal geometry domain. Further theoretical research work is
needed to take the preliminary concepts discussed in this paper, into mainstream
fractal geometry.
We would specially like to thank Carl Johansen, whose open sourced Mandelbrot
viewer we borrowed.
